# Smart-Cradle-System-using-IoT
A smart cradle system that uses IoT theory can automatically monitor a baby's parameters, such as temperature, heartbeat, and motion. The system can also send alerts to the parent's smartphone when the baby cries, the mattress gets wet, or the baby doesn't stop crying after a certain amount of time.
